# Spendalizer

A basic demo of a financial app which helps you budget and plan your expenses, made using AngularJS, HTML5 and CSS3.
This was made for the purpose of a financial fitness hackathon conducted by MassMutual. 
Two of us (Vinay Hegde and Vishal Rao) worked on this and although its only for demo purposes at the moment,
we hope to finish it sometime in the future. 

To run the application:
- Download node.js
- download the repo
- cd into the repo and run the command "npm install http-server"
- run the command "http-server"
- Open Chrome and go to "localhost:8080/index.html"
